# Tribe System Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete tribe system with API routes, controllers, services, and socket support.

## Files Created

### Server-Side
1. **server/src/controllers/tribeController.js** (6.0KB)
   - `getAllTribes()` - Get all available tribes
   - `getTribe(tribeId)` - Get specific tribe details
   - `getLeaderboard(period, limit)` - Get tribe leaderboard
   - `joinTribe(tribeId)` - Join a tribe with 30-day cooldown
   - `getMyTribe()` - Get user's current tribe
   - `awardPoints(reason, points)` - Award points to tribe

2. **server/src/routes/tribe.routes.js** (1.1KB)
   - Public: `GET /api/tribes`
   - Protected: `GET /api/tribes/leaderboard`, `GET /api/tribes/my-tribe`, `POST /api/tribes/join`, `POST /api/tribes/points/award`, `GET /api/tribes/:tribeId`

### Client-Side
3. **client/src/services/tribeService.js** (3.6KB)
   - Complete service layer with all CRUD operations
   - Consistent API with other services
   - Token-based authentication

## Files Modified

### Socket Service
4. **server/src/sockets/socketService.js**
   - Added `emitTribeUpdate(tribeId, updateData)` for real-time updates
   - Added `emitWeeklyReset(resetData)` for broadcast resets
   - Added `join-tribe` and `leave-tribe` event handlers
   - Auto-joins users to tribe rooms on connection

### Database Model
5. **server/src/models/User.js** (17KB)
   - Added `canSwitchAt` field to tribe object for 30-day cooldown

### Service Enhancement
6. **server/src/services/tribeService.js**
   - Fixed `emitWeeklyReset()` method call

## Additional Fixes
- Fixed `server/src/routes/leaderboard.routes.js` - validation middleware issues
- Fixed `server/src/routes/progression.routes.js` - validation and rate limiting issues
- Added `validateRequest` alias to `server/src/middleware/validation.js` for backwards compatibility

## Features Implemented

### Core Functionality
- ✅ Get all tribes
- ✅ Get specific tribe details
- ✅ Join tribe with 30-day cooldown protection
- ✅ Get user's current tribe
- ✅ Get tribe leaderboard (weekly/all-time)
- ✅ Award points to tribes
- ✅ Real-time updates via WebSockets
- ✅ Weekly reset with broadcast

### Socket Events
- `tribe_update` - Emitted to specific tribe room
- `tribe_weekly_reset` - Broadcast to all clients
- `join-tribe` - Manual tribe room joining
- `leave-tribe` - Manual tribe room leaving

## API Endpoints

### Public Routes
- `GET /api/tribes` - List all tribes (no auth required)

### Protected Routes  
- `GET /api/tribes/leaderboard?period=week&limit=50` - Get leaderboard
- `GET /api/tribes/my-tribe` - Get user's current tribe
- `POST /api/tribes/join` - Join a tribe (requires tribeId in body)
- `POST /api/tribes/points/award` - Award points (internal use)
- `GET /api/tribes/:tribeId` - Get specific tribe details

## Testing Status
✅ Tribe routes loaded successfully
✅ Tribe controller loaded successfully  
✅ No linter errors
✅ All imports resolved

## Next Steps
1. Test endpoints with actual HTTP requests
2. Implement frontend components using the service
3. Add unit tests for controller methods
4. Test socket events in real-time scenarios
5. Verify tribe leaderboard calculations
