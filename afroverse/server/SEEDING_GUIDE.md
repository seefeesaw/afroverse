# Database Seeding Guide for Postman Testing

## Overview

This guide explains how to seed your database with comprehensive test data for Postman API testing. The seeding script creates realistic data across all models with proper relationships.

## Quick Start

### 1. Make sure your MongoDB is running

```bash
# Check if MongoDB is running
mongosh

# Or start it if needed
# On macOS with Homebrew:
brew services start mongodb-community

# On Linux:
sudo systemctl start mongodb
```

### 2. Set up environment variables

Make sure your `.env` file has the correct MongoDB connection string:

```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/afroverse
MONGODB_DB=afroverse
```

### 3. Run the seed script

```bash
cd server
node src/seeders/seed.js
```

## Resetting the Database

If you need to start fresh:

```bash
# Connect to MongoDB
mongosh

# Switch to your database
use afroverse

# Drop all collections
db.dropDatabase()

# Re-run the seed script
node src/seeders/seed.js
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "MongoDB connection failed"
**Solution:** Make sure MongoDB is running and the connection string in `.env` is correct.

### Issue: "Duplicate key error"
**Solution:** The database already has seeded data. Drop the database first or the script will skip duplicates.

### Issue: "Model not found"
**Solution:** Make sure you're running the script from the `server` directory.

### Issue: "Not enough users/transformations for battles"
**Solution:** The script seeds data in order. If battles fail, check if users and transformations were created successfully.

## Advanced Usage

### Seed Only Specific Models

You can modify the `main()` function in `seed.js` to seed only what you need:

```javascript
// In seed.js main() function, comment out what you don't need
async function main() {
  await connect();
  
  await seedTribes();
  await seedUsers();
  // await seedVideos();  // Skip videos
  // await seedBattles(); // Skip battles
  
  await mongoose.connection.close();
}
```

### Adjust Data Quantity

Modify the loop counts in each seed function:

```javascript
// In seedUsers() function
for (let i = 0; i < 15; i++) {  // Change 15 to desired number
  // ...
}

// In seedVideos() function  
for (let i = 0; i < 50; i++) {  // Change 50 to desired number
  // ...
}
```

### Custom Test Data

Add your own test scenarios:

```javascript
// In seedUsers() after the main loop
const customUser = new User({
  phone: '+1234567890',
  username: 'custom_tester',
  // ... your custom fields
});
await customUser.save();
```

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Run the seed script
2. üß™ Import Postman collection (in `postman/` directory)
3. üîë Use seeded phone numbers for authentication
4. üöÄ Start testing your API endpoints!

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the logs: `server/logs/combined.log`
2. Review the seed script: `server/src/seeders/seed.js`
3. Check model schemas in `server/src/models/`
